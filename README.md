This repository is an archive for a previous research paper titled [Precision Agriculture: Soil Moisture-based IoT Drip Irrigation System to Optimize Water Usage for Aglaonema in Greenhouse Environment](https://ijhst.ut.ac.ir/article_101039_b627a252ff56bf7ad8794ce35e8b953c.pdf), published by the [International Journal of Horticultural Science and Technology](https://ijhst.ut.ac.ir/). This research paper proposes the development of a smart IoT-based irrigation system designed to test varying soil moisture levels for optimized plant (Aglaonema 'Stardust') irrigation. The system also collects data generated by various sensors.
A Raspberry Pi 3B board will be utilized to send sensor data collected by the three drip irrigation module (Arduino Uno R3) to Microsoft Azure's CosmosDB. A detailed image of the system architecture and circuit diagram can be seen below.
