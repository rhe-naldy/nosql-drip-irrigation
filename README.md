This repository is an archive for a previous research paper titled [Precision Agriculture: Soil Moisture-based IoT Drip Irrigation System to Optimize Water Usage for Aglaonema in Greenhouse Environment](https://ijhst.ut.ac.ir/article_101039_b627a252ff56bf7ad8794ce35e8b953c.pdf), published by the [International Journal of Horticultural Science and Technology](https://ijhst.ut.ac.ir/). This research paper proposes the development of a smart IoT-based irrigation system designed to test varying soil moisture levels for optimized plant (Aglaonema 'Stardust') irrigation. The system also collects data generated by various sensors.
A Raspberry Pi 3B board will be utilized to send sensor data collected by the three drip irrigation module (Arduino Uno R3) to Microsoft Azure's CosmosDB, while the Arduino Uno R3 microcontrollers are used to irrigate and gather sensor data from each plant. 

The firmware for both arduino and raspberry pi board can be accessed in the corresponding folders, namely [arduino/arduino_firmware.ino](https://github.com/rhe-naldy/nosql-drip-irrigation/blob/main/arduino/arduino_firmware.ino) and [raspberry_pi/send_data.py](https://github.com/rhe-naldy/nosql-drip-irrigation/blob/main/raspberry_pi/send_data.py).


Below are a detailed image of the system architecture and circuit diagram, which can be seen below.
